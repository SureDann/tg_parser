This is a normal parsing of Telegram accounts and messages from a channel or chats, create a config.ini file and current data in the parser_1.py file directory

[Telegram]
app_id=your app id
api_hash=your app hash
username = tg username without "@"

after running the script, you will be asked to log in through your account, after successful authorization you will be asked for a link to the channel or chat in which you are the administrator. After entering the link, enjoy parsing ;)
